    "## Cyclic features\n",
    "There are three cyclic features here: wind direction (angle), time of year (seasonal cycle), and time of day (diurnal cycle). In a cyclic feature, points at the beginning and end of the data ranges are actually adjacent: 0 degrees is close to 359 degreees, January is close to December, and 00:01 is close to 23:59. What would normally be simple linear operations, like feature1 - feature2, are non-linear with cyclic features. There are two ways to capture these relationships: 1) reimplement every model to use cyclic-aware arithmetic, or 2) convert the cyclic features to 2 component dimensions with sine and cosine transforms. Option 2 is the practical choice, and is what I'll do here.\n",

    "### Wind Direction\n",

    "1. there are multiple aggregate metrics (mean, min, max) which are each cyclical, and \n",
    "2. there are two sets of wind direction measurements, at different heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is to represent them in a way that downstream models, which have no concept of cyclic operations, can make meaningful linear combinations or decision splits with. One option is to simply sin/cos transform all the features, but that leaves the models to figure everything out on their own. That condemns a linear model to irrelevance, and even nonlinear models need lots of data to succeed with that approach (possibly more than I have). Instead, I'll reparamaterize this information to simultaneously better represent what what I actually care about AND reduce the importance of cyclic wrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Better representation (re-paramaterization) of cyclic aggregate stats\n",
    "The purpose of mean, min, max, and var stats is to describe the distribution of wind direction angles. A gaussian-like distribution is defined by location and 'spread'. Location is an absolute angular position, and is thus cyclical. But spread is relative and doesn't need any special treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "One flaw of the current representation is that min and max values are locations, but their purpose is to describe spread. By creating relative representations of min and max, I can remove the cyclic dependence and simplify the data representation. Then comparisons can be done with linear operations, and I don't need to sin/cos transform them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, I replace them with (min - mean) and (max - mean). I'll also express the differences as z-scores by dividing by direction standard deviation.\n",

    "Now all location information is contained in the mean, and sine/cosine transformations are only needed on a single aggregate."

    "Redundant measurements are highly correlated. I'll express them additively, in terms of a reference direction and the difference between them (called veer, in meteorology jargon). I won't sin/cos transform this location, instead leaving the difference as a single dimension with range (-180, 180]. This is simply because there will rarely be differences more than 90 degrees, so cyclic wrapping is less of a concern.\n",
